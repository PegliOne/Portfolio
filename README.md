# Portfolio

This is a portfolio website that I have built to showcase my work.

## Features

The portfolio consists of a landing page and a projects page.

Both pages feature a heading with my name and title, a navbar with links to the two pages and a footer with my contact details.

The landing page of the portfolio also features the about section and a skills section. The projects page lists my completed projects.

Currently the projects page only includes the Tic-Tac-Toe project I made while completing General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course, since the other projects I made are no longer hosted. I have include three additional blank sections so that I can add more projects later.

## Technologies Used

- HTML (including semantic elements and BEM class naming conventions)
- CSS (including using flexbox, CSS grid and media queries to achieve a responsive layout)
- SCSS (including the use of variables, mixins and modules)
- Git Version Control (including the use of branches to add new features)
